Preprocessing brain MRI image using cImage in Python

Brain MRI Preprocessing using cImage

This project demonstrates how to load and display a brain MRI image using the `cImage` library in Python. This image is the first step in preprocessing for an AI model aimed at brain tumor detection.

Files Included

- `display_mri_image.py`: Python script using `cImage` to load and display the MRI image.
- `np_brain_image.jpg`: Sample brain MRI image.

 Requirements

- Python 3.9
- `cImage.py` module (manually added to site-packages)
- Windows (for `ImageWin` support)

 How to Run

1. Make sure `cImage.py` is installed in your Python environment.
2. Run `display_mri_image.py` in IDLE or another Python IDE.
3. A window will open displaying the brain MRI image. Click the window to close it.

 Output

Displays this MRI image:
